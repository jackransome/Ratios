Proper GUI system
	Needs text drawing
	buttons
Design and implement better intuitive interface for microtonality
	Ability to select 2 notes and see the ratio between them
	A visual (colour?) indicator of the simplicity of ratio between different notes
		could be brown - red - yellow - green gradient for dissonance to simplicity
		Maybe draw verticle(diagonal in some cases?) coloured lines between every note in selection (make this a setting?)
			need to write some code to find shortest line between two line segments
Synth selector GUI (instrument selector? wityh colour coding options)
Ability to change time slice dimensions
	should be a gui thing
Ability to choose different samples
	gui thing(like the 3ddls file browser but you can click)
Ability to set position to play from
	maybe clicking at a point without selecting a note sets the next start play time to that point
A help page for controls(must be easily updatable)
	should use some text drawing function for this part, maybe it'll read a txt file?
Renderer option:
	creating wav file from track
